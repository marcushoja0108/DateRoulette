This is an app based of the game "scratch a date". The intention is to get a random date you will have to perform. You start off by either logging in to one of the registered users or making a new one. The main page consists of the spin button and the wheel of opportunities. From here you can also set filters to specify your date more. The system will then pick a random date based on your filters. Some of these will also update over time as you complete dates.

When you spin the wheel you will be sent to the info page of the date. Here you will get a little bit of information about it and read some previous reviews. If the date is above 1000kr max price you will have the option of skipping it. After accepting you will be locked to an ongoing page until you complete the date. From here you can only choose to end the date wich takes you to the review page. On this you will have to leave a star rating, comment and upload a picture as a memory from the date. If you cancel you will be sent back to the ongoing screen.

When you click on the profile icon from the main page you will be sent to your profile. From here you can search for users and send them a partner request. If they accept you will get the double date option on the main page. When you click on this you can see available double dates in your area or create a new double date for others to join. From the profile page you will also have access to your memories. Here you can see all your previous dates with their memory photo and comment.
